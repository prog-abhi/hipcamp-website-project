# Hipcamp Website Project

The objective of this project is to make a pixel perfect homepage copy of the popular website [Hipcamp](https://www.hipcamp.com/en-US).
To make sure all of the HTML and CSS elements on the page are identified. For example, if there is a hover effect over a button or an image carousel feature on the page, we try to replicate that down to the pixel.

The goal is to try to make as close to a pixel-perfect copy as possible with all of the CSS features that are presented on their homepage.

Note: Site functionality yet to be implemented
